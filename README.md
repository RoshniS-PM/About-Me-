Leveraging my expertise as a **Technical Program & Product leader, Scrum Master, and Agile coach**, I excel at building high-performing, cross-functional teams and ensuring operational excellence to scale businesses for growth and translating complex business requirements into actionable technical roadmaps and vice versa, bridging the gap between executive stakeholders and engineering teams. My expertise spans **B2B and B2C** models across diverse sectors including tech, retail, health and wellness, and hospitality.

**My Professional Journey**

My career has been a purposeful journey of growth, marked by a deep-seated desire to build and lead, blending technical expertise with a sharp business acumen. It's a story that begins with a foundation in software development and evolves into a passion for product and program leadership, culminating in scaling an innovative tech startup.

**The Foundation: Building the Technical Core**

I began my career at **Tech Mahindra,** a multinational IT services company, where I built my expertise in **Business Intelligence** tools and data warehousing techniques. As a Software Developer, I learned to use strong analytical skills to interpret data, create reports, and drive informed decision-making. This early experience gave me a solid understanding of the software development lifecycle **(SDLC)** and the critical role of data in business strategy, skills that would become the bedrock of my future roles.


**The Pivot: Embracing the Entrepreneurial Spirit**

Driven by an **entrepreneurial** spirit, I **co-founded** an event management company, Yello Feathers, in Dubai. As a Co-Founder, I was responsible for everything from securing approvals to building a brand from scratch. This role taught me invaluable lessons in leading end-to-end event execution, negotiating with vendors, and **building strong client relations**.

Following this, I brought my newfound skills in **logistics and operations** to the culinary world as an Event and Logistics Manager at Drew’s Catering & Events in Vancouver. Here, I managed complex end-to-end logistics for executive events and optimized supply chain efficiency. These experiences solidified my ability to manage complex operations, lead teams, and drive efficiency—all in high-stakes environments.

**The Convergence: Holistic Leadership at a High-Growth Tech Startup**

My journey reached a new level when I joined UpMeals, a **high-growth tech startup**. As a **key early hire,** I was instrumental in scaling the company from a concept to over **60 employees**, actively shaping its dynamic growth from the ground up. In the initial days, my role was broad and hands-on—I oversaw logistics, managed packaging, and personally built and streamlined processes and team structures to ensure optimal efficiency. I also hired, mentored, and developed a high-performing team across different departments.

My leadership extended to the business operations side, where I spearheaded the company’s success with **government grant** **applications**. I was the primary liaison and led all file claiming and documentation processes, successfully securing **$1.3M** in multi-level government funding across five consecutive years and extending to **AI projects**.
On the technical front, I was a holistic leader for the company’s core product lines. I led the end-to-end project lifecycle for the **SmartVending infrastructure**, managing **25+** installations with **IoT** integration. From contract negotiation and vendor onboarding to on-site delivery and client relations, I oversaw every aspect of these complex projects. This chapter of my career allowed me to demonstrate comprehensive leadership in areas like compliance, and optimizing operational efficiency.

Ultimately, I leveraged this comprehensive experience to drive the transformation of a 3+ year internal tool into a top-rated **Angular-based SaaS** product. My focus was always on driving results, and the impact was clear: we achieved a **50–60%** increase in sales efficiency and automated **150K**+ tasks annually, enabling **90%** faster R&D cycles for product development.
